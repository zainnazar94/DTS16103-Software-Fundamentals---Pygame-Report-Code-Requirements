# DTS16103-Software-Fundamentals---Pygame-Report- READ.ME
This project was based around building and designing a software system using programming languages. I decided to base my project off the 'Pong Game'. 
this allowed me to enhance good coding practices by experimenting with various functions whilst making sure the game window is completely bug free.


To access the 'Pong game' i have created: --------------Please Read Below------------------
1. install python versions 3.7 whether this be through Anaconda - Spyder, Pycharm or other.
2. After installing Python, install pygame through the anaconda or Python command prompt and type 'pip install Pygame'. 
3. the code can be run through pycharm or python itself. To know if Pygame was successfully installed, type 'import pygame' into your console on Spyder or Python. If a message along th lines of 'Hello from the Pygame community' is displayed, it has been successful.
4. copy and paste the code from github repo into the python console/text window and press enter to begin the code
5.The game should then load on a new window.
